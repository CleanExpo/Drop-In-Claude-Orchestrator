# Rationale

Why this orchestrator architecture exists and how it solves common development challenges.

## The Problem

When working with AI assistants like Claude on complex development projects, several challenges emerge:

### 1. Context Overload
- Single-threaded conversations lose focus
- Important details get buried in long discussions
- Hard to maintain context across multiple work sessions

### 2. Skill Specialization
- Testing requires different expertise than implementation
- Research needs different tools than deployment
- One generalist approach doesn't optimize for each task type

### 3. Safety Concerns
- Accidental destructive operations (file deletions, bad deployments)
- Unvalidated data operations
- Unclear boundaries on what actions are safe

### 4. Workflow Fragmentation
- Hard to follow consistent processes
- Knowledge not captured or reused
- Each developer reinvents the wheel

## The Solution: Agent Orchestration

The Claude Orchestrator Starter provides a structured approach:

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Specialized Agents
Each agent has a focused role with specific tools and patterns:

```
coder → implementation
tester → validation  
research → information gathering
integrator → connecting pieces
stuck → problem recognition
deployer → safe deployment
docs → documentation
data → data operations
```

**Benefits:**
- **Expertise**: Each agent optimized for its domain
- **Clarity**: Clear responsibility boundaries
- **Reusability**: Patterns captured in agent definitions

#### 2. Orchestrator as Router
The orchestrator analyzes requests and routes to appropriate agents:

```
User Request
    ↓
Orchestrator (analyzes)
    ↓
Routes to Agent(s)
    ↓
Agents Execute
    ↓
Integrator (if needed)
    ↓
Result to User
```

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic**: Right agent selected automatically
- **Efficient**: No over-thinking simple tasks
- **Scalable**: Add agents without changing core

#### 3. MCP for Tool Access
Model Context Protocol provides controlled access to:
- **Filesystem**: Read/write project files
- **Git**: Repository information
- **Playwright**: Browser testing
- **Browser**: Web research
- **Jina**: Content extraction

**Benefits:**
- **Standard**: Protocol-based, not ad-hoc
- **Safe**: Permissions and approval controls
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools

#### 4. Configuration-Driven
Behavior controlled via config files:

```yaml
agents:
  coder:
    enabled: true
    autoApprove: false
    
mcp:
  playwright:
    enabled: true
    config: "./mcp/playwright.config.json"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Flexible**: Adapt to project needs
- **Transparent**: Behavior is explicit
- **Versioned**: Config in version control

## Why This Shape?

### Design Decisions

#### Decision: Separate Agent Files
**Rationale:** Each agent is a complete, self-contained specification. This makes them:
- Easy to understand in isolation
- Simple to customize
- Reusable across projects

**Alternative Considered:** Single agent definition file
**Why Not:** Would become too large and hard to navigate

#### Decision: Orchestrator Coordinates
**Rationale:** Central coordination point provides:
- Consistent routing logic
- Single source of truth for workflows
- Clear handoff protocols

**Alternative Considered:** Peer-to-peer agent communication
**Why Not:** Would create spaghetti dependencies

#### Decision: MCP for Tools
**Rationale:** Standard protocol ensures:
- Tool providers can be swapped
- Permission model is clear
- Community tools can be added

**Alternative Considered:** Custom tool implementations
**Why Not:** Reinventing the wheel, no ecosystem

#### Decision: YAML for Config
**Rationale:** Human-readable configuration that:
- Non-developers can modify
- Supports comments
- Version controls well

**Alternative Considered:** JSON
**Why Not:** No comments, less readable

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. Explicit Over Implicit
- Clear agent definitions
- Documented handoff points
- Visible routing decisions

#### 2. Safety First
- Read-only by default
- Approval gates for risky operations
- Protected paths and secrets

#### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Core agents always available
- Optional agents add capabilities
- MCP servers added as needed

#### 4. Convention Over Configuration
- Standard file locations
- Consistent naming
- Sensible defaults

## How It Works in Practice

### Example: Feature Development

**Request:** "Add user search functionality"

**Orchestrator Analysis:**
- Multi-step feature requiring multiple agents
- Follows "feature" workflow template

**Execution:**
```
1. research agent
   - Finds search implementation patterns
   - Gathers performance best practices
   - Documents approach

2. coder agent
   - Implements search endpoint
   - Creates search UI component
   - Adds debouncing/optimization

3. tester agent
   - Creates search tests
   - Tests edge cases
   - Validates performance

4. integrator agent
   - Wires search to navigation
   - Connects API to UI
   - Ensures consistent styling

5. docs agent
   - Documents search usage
   - Updates API docs
```

**Result:** Complete, tested, documented feature

### Example: Bug Fix

**Request:** "API timing out on large requests"

**Orchestrator Analysis:**
- Requires investigation then fix
- Follows "bugfix" workflow

**Execution:**
```
1. research agent
   - Reviews API logs
   - Checks related issues
   - Identifies timeout pattern

2. stuck agent
   - Recognizes "performance bottleneck" pattern
   - Suggests pagination approach

3. coder agent
   - Implements pagination
   - Adds request size limits
   - Updates error handling

4. tester agent
   - Creates load test
   - Verifies fix under scale
   - Adds regression test
```

**Result:** Root cause fixed, won't regress
